MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It is a software design pattern for developing web applications.

The MVC pattern divides the  application into three main components:

Model: This component represents the data of the application and the business logic. It handles the logic for retrieving and updating data from a database or other source.

View: This component is responsible for displaying the data to the user. It is the user interface (UI) of the application.

Controller: This component receives user input and sends commands to the model and view. It acts as a mediator between the model and view, updating the view when the model changes and updating the model when the user interacts with the view.

Using the MVC pattern helps to keep the code organized and separation of concerns, making it easier to develop and maintain the application.
